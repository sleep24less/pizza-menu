I created an application to manage Pizzeria menu using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS without
using any third party libraries or frameworks.

It has more functionality than my previous library app (item sorting, sessionStorage, modal 
and popup backround overlays, input field for adding multiple ingredients before submitting)

I wanted to use modules in practice for variable/function encapsulation and more organised code. 
Next step will be to put to practice OOP.
