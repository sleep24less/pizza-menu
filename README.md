I created an application to manage Pizzeria menu using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS without
using any third party libraries or frameworks.

It has more functionality than my previous library app:
- item sorting
- sessionStorage
- modal 
- popup backround overlays
- input field for adding multiple ingredients before submitting

I wanted to use modules in practice for variable/function encapsulation and more organised code. 
Next step will be to put to practice OOP.
